## Overview 📝

I successfully crafted an online catalog for **Lubabalo's Shoe Shop** that provides an intuitive and user-friendly way for customers to browse and shop for shoes. The web application allows users to filter shoes based on various attributes like color, size, and brand.

## Technologies Used 💻

### Handlebars.js 
I leveraged Handlebars for templating to keep my HTML clean and separate from JavaScript. This made it incredibly efficient to dynamically render shoe data on the web page.

### Local Storage
To enhance the user experience, I used the Local Storage API for persistent storage of the shopping basket. This enables customers to keep their selected items even after refreshing the webpage.

## Core Features 🌟

### Search Functionality 🔍
I built a powerful search functionality where users can effortlessly select desired attributes from dropdown menus. Once the user hits the search button, all matching shoes, their prices, and stock numbers are displayed.

### Dynamic Stock Management 📦
I implemented real-time stock management. As customers add items to their shopping baskets, the in-stock numbers are dynamically updated.

### Shopping Basket 🛒
Customers can easily add selected shoes to a shopping basket. They can also view, add, or remove items before proceeding to checkout.

### Checkout and Cancel 🛍️
For a seamless shopping experience, I added a checkout button that clears the basket and maintains the adjusted stock numbers. If a user wishes to cancel the basket, the stock numbers are reverted back to their original count.

## Deployment 🌐

I deployed the application on GitHub Pages, making it widely accessible and easy to use.

## Future Enhancements 🚀

I plan to extend the functionality of this application by adding form validation, improving the UI, and possibly integrating a back-end database for more persistent storage of data.
