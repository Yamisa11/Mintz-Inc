Summary of My Project for Lubabalo's Shoe Shop
Overview

I successfully developed an online catalog for Lubabalo's shoe shop, allowing customers to browse and search for shoes based on various attributes such as color, size, and brand.
Technologies Utilized

    Handlebars.js: I implemented Handlebars for templating to dynamically render shoe data on the webpage. This allowed me to keep the HTML clean and separate from the JavaScript logic.

    Local Storage: I used the Local Storage API to persist the shopping basket data, allowing customers to maintain their basket even after refreshing the page or coming back later.

Core Features

    Search Functionality: I created a search functionality where users can select the desired shoe attributes from dropdown menus. After hitting the search button, the shoes that match the criteria are displayed along with their prices and the number of items in stock.

    Dynamic Stock Management: I implemented a dynamic stock management system that updates the in-stock numbers in real-time as customers add items to their shopping baskets.

    Shopping Basket: I added a feature that allows customers to add shoes to a shopping basket. They can view this basket, add or remove items, and proceed to checkout.

    Checkout and Cancel Options: I incorporated a checkout button that clears the shopping basket while maintaining the adjusted stock numbers. If a customer decides to cancel, I made sure the stock numbers are reverted back to their original count.

Deployment

I deployed the project on GitHub Pages, making it easily accessible to Lubabalo's customers.

Overall, I met all the requirements Lubabalo had for his online shoe shop and provided an intuitive, user-friendly shopping experience for his customers.
